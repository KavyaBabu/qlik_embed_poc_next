1. remove the logger in next line 101, from app.py 2. _construct_s3_key is unneccessary abstraction remove it from vipe_client 3. No try catch what if it fails? in upload_file -> vipe_client 4. line 36 vipe_client Misleading the upload should have been successful at this point 5. Only needed if enable polling is true so should be in the if statement to avoid unnecessary if assignment in line 161 -> app.py 6. line 170 Avoid generic exception we should know when code fails, message assumes a time out. We should probably create a Vipe client exception and make the vipe client raise custom exceptions we expect to manage 7. Don't generically exception you should know why the function will fail -> in work_order_status_updater return true or false 8. Abstract polling into it's own function -> on line 165-> app.py 9. Function length is crazy, we should have functions that are 120 lines long. I'm not sure why RUFF isn't enforcing this.Please break the handler down into functions with single responsibility over parts of the handler process. 

please address all these pointers in this 3 file and give complete fixed solution, and make sure i won't get any other pr comments over this. complete clean, no comments, no generic exception, no unneccessary functions, variables etc. complete app.py should be in 100 to 110 lines max
